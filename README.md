# Codsoft-Project-1
As part of my internship at CodSoft, I designed a calculator using Python, successfully completing Task 01. This project allowed me to apply and enhance my programming skills in a practical setting. It was a rewarding experience that combined learning and creativity. I'm grateful to the CodSoft team for their support and guidance throughout the project.
